  <h1>NutreoAI – Refund Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> January 1, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>At NutreoAI, we offer digital services through in-app subscriptions. Because our products are delivered instantly and provide immediate access to premium features, refunds are generally not available after purchase.</p>

  <h2>2. Free Trial</h2>
  <p>NutreoAI may offer a free trial period so you can explore premium features before committing to a paid plan. If you do not cancel before the trial ends, the subscription will automatically begin, and you will be charged.</p>

  <h2>3. Subscription Management</h2>
  <p>You can cancel or manage your subscription at any time through your app store account:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Play:</strong> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/account/subscriptions" target="_blank">Manage subscriptions</a></li>
    <li><strong>Apple App Store:</strong> <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039" target="_blank">Manage subscriptions</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Canceling a subscription will stop future charges but does not trigger a refund for previous payments.</p>

  <h2>4. Refund Requests</h2>
  <p>If you believe you were charged by mistake or experienced a technical issue, please contact us within 48 hours of the charge:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Email: support@NutreoAI.app</li>
    <li>In-app feedback form</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Refund requests will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Approved refunds will be processed through your original payment method.</p>

  <h2>5. Purchases Made Through App Stores</h2>
  <p>All payments and refunds are managed by Google Play or Apple. We do not have direct access to your payment details and cannot issue refunds ourselves. If your refund is approved, it will be processed by the respective store.</p>

  <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this Refund Policy, please contact us at:</p>
